### üåü Full Control

- No need for paid third-party services for simple tasks like rate limiting, websockets, cron jobs, or authentication. This boilerplate gives you full control of your data and backend services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/azharalifauzi/omnigate
cd omnigate

# Instal packages
pnpm install

# Copy environment and set values for all of them
cp .env.example .env
```

### Setting up Database

You need to install PostgreSQL and create a database first. After that you have to set the `DATABASE_URL` inside `.env` file.

**Important**: before run `pnpm seed` you have to set values for `INITIAL_USER_EMAIL` and `INITIAL_USER_NAME` inside `.env` file.

```bash
# Migrate DB
pnpm migrate

# Seed DB
pnpm seed
```

Once you seed the DB, you'll see `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` in the terminal. Copy the value from terminal to `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` in `.env`.

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Frontend and backend start together with full type safety and no CORS issues.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Testing

**Important**: Before run the test, you need to create another database specific for testing purpose, so your database that is used for development won't losing the data.

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

## üî® Useful Utility and Hooks

### Accessing User and Permission Data

Easily retrieve user information and manage permissions in both client and server components with these utilities.

#### **Client Components**

Use the `useUser` hook to access user details and check permissions in client components.

```tsx
'use client'
import { useUser } from '~/hooks'

function Component() {
  const { user, getPermission } = useUser()

  const isGranted = getPermission('read:data')

  if (!isGranted) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Name: {user.name}</div>
      <div>Email: {user.email}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### **Server Components**

In server components, use the `getServerSideUserObject` utility for similar functionality.

```ts
import { getServerSideUserObject } from '~/utils/server'

function Page() {
  const { user, getPermission } = getServerSideUserObject()
}
```

#### **Advanced Permission Checks**

You can also check multiple permissions with helper functions like `somePermissions` and `everyPermissions`.

```ts
import { somePermission, everyPermission } from '~/utils/auth'

function Component() {
  const { getPermission } = useUser()

  // Will return true if user has one of the permissions
  const canReadOrWriteRole = getPermission(
    somePermissions(['write:roles', 'read:roles']),
  )

  // Will return true when user has all the permissions
  const canReadAndWriteRole = everyPermission(
    everyPermissions(['write:roles', 'read:roles']),
  )
}
```

## üì¶ Deployment

Deploy easily using Docker:
