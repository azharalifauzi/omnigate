## üöÄ Features

### ‚ö° Developer Experience

- **Zero Hassle Dev Mode**: Start your app instantly with minimum setup. No CORS issues, no Docker requirement during development‚Äîjust code and go.
- **Preconfigured Scripts**: Everything is set up for you‚Äîdev, test, build, lint, lint-staged, pre-commit hooks‚Äîit just works out of the box.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
  - [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [@tanstack/react-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4)
- **Backend**:
  - üî• [Hono.js](https://hono.dev/)
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  - [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
  - **Hono RPC** for fully type-safe API calls between frontend and backend.

### üîê Authentication

- Built-in support for:
  - **Google Sign-In**
  - **OTP-based passwordless login**
- **Role-Based Access Permissions**: Define and enforce permissions based on user roles seamlessly.
- **Organization Support**: Manage multiple organizations with role-specific access within each organization.
- **Feature Flag**: Easily manage feature flag via UI Dashboard.
- **Built-in Dashboard UI**: Manage authentication related stuff using well crafted UI under `/admin` path.

### üö¢ Deployment Made Easy

- **Dockerized Deployment**: Comes with Docker Compose and optimized Dockerfiles, making it a breeze to deploy to platforms like [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) or [Caprover](https://caprover.com/).
- **Small Docker Image Size**: It only takes up 143 MB using single container mode, and 400 MB if using docker compose for all services (Frontend, Backend, and Nginx).

### üåü Full Control

- No need for paid third-party services for simple tasks like rate limiting, websockets, cron jobs, or authentication. This boilerplate gives you full control of your data and backend services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/azharalifauzi/omnigate
cd omnigate

# Instal packages
pnpm install

# Copy environment and set values for all of them
cp .env.example .env
```

### Setting up Database

You need to install PostgreSQL and create a database first. After that you have to set the `DATABASE_URL` inside `.env` file.

**Important**: before run `pnpm seed` you have to set values for `INITIAL_USER_EMAIL` and `INITIAL_USER_NAME` inside `.env` file.

```bash
# Migrate DB
pnpm migrate

# Seed DB
pnpm seed
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Frontend and backend start together with full type safety and no CORS issues.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Testing

**Important**: Before run the test, you need to create another database specific for testing purpose, so your database that is used for development won't losing the data.

```bash
pnpm test:unit
```

## üî® Useful Utility and Hooks

### Accessing User and Permission Data

Easily retrieve user information and manage permissions in both client and server components with these utilities.

#### **Client Components**

Use the `useUser` hook to access user details and check permissions in client components.

```tsx
'use client'
import { useUser } from '~/hooks'

function Component() {
  const { user, getPermission } = useUser()

  const isGranted = getPermission('read:data')

  if (!isGranted) {
    return null
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Name: {user.name}</div>
      <div>Email: {user.email}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### **Server Components**

In server components, use the `getUserServerSession` utility for similar functionality.

```ts
import { getUserServerSession } from '~/utils/server'

function Page() {
  const { user, getPermission } = await getUserServerSession()
}
```

#### **Feature Flag**

You can check whether the feature flag is enabled or not using the `getFeatureFlag` function.

```ts
function Component() {
  const { getFeatureFlag } = useUser()

  const canExportPdf = getFeatureFlag('export-pdf')
}
```

#### **Advanced Permission Checks**

You can also check multiple permissions with helper functions like `somePermissions` and `everyPermissions`.

```ts
import { somePermission, everyPermission } from '~/utils/auth'

function Component() {
  const { getPermission } = useUser()

  // Will return true if user has one of the permissions
  const canReadOrWriteRole = getPermission(
    somePermissions(['write:roles', 'read:roles']),
  )

  // Will return true when user has all the permissions
  const canReadAndWriteRole = getPermission(
    everyPermissions(['write:roles', 'read:roles']),
  )
}
```

### Data Fetching Utils

#### **Hono client RPC**

In order to get type safety when fetching data you can use `client` and `unwrapResponse` fetcher utility.

```ts
'use client'
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { client, unwrapResponse, QueryKey } from '~/utils/fetcher'

function Component() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: [QueryKey.Organization],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const res = client.api.v1.organization.$get({
        query: {
          page: '1',
        },
      })

      const { data } = await unwrapResponse(res)

      return data
    },
  })
}
```

#### **Server Utility**

- `generateJsonResponse` , this function will structurize the API response and still give the type safety.

```ts
import { generateJsonResponse } from '~/lib/response'

new Hono().get('/user', (c) => {
  // It will return  this
  // {
  //   statusCode: 200,
  //   message: 'OK',
  //   data: {
  //     id: 1,
  //     name: 'John'
  //   }
  // }
  return generateJsonResponse(c, {
    id: 1,
    name: 'John',
  })
})
```

- `ServerError` , this class is extended from `Error` class that will help handling error.

```ts
import { ServerError } from '~/lib/error'

new Hono().get('/user', () => {
  throw new ServerError({
    statusCode: 404,
    message: 'Failed to get user',
    description: 'User is not found',
  })
})
```

> Note: If `ServerError` is used together with `unwrapResponse` and `useQuery` or `useMutation` from Tanstack Query, it will automatically trigger a toast from `sonner` to give error information to user.

## üì¶ Deployment

### Deploy easily using Docker Compose:

```bash
# App wil run on port 3000
docker-compose up --build
```

### Single Container Option

Using single container will make your final image even smaller (only 143 MB), and it would be easier to deploy to services like Coolify.

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t omnigate -f docker/single-file.Dockerfile .

# Run container
docker run --name omnigate --env-file .env --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -p 3000:3000 omnigate
```

### Deploying with Coolify

If you wish to deploy using Coolify you can follow the config below, and don't forget to setup environment variables under "Environment Variables" tab.

<img width="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c2b6697-5a37-4a91-a750-294b13fb8372" />

By following config above, you will run Coolify build using Docker, and pointing your domain to port 3000, and for everything under `/api` route will be pointed to port 4000.
